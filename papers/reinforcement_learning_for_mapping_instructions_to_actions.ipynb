    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning approach for mapping natural language instructions to sequences of executable actions. We assume access to a reward function that defines the quality of the executed actions. During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward. We use a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of a log-linear model to interpret instructions in two domains - Windows troubleshooting guides and game tutorials. Our results demonstrate that this technique can rival supervised learning techniques while requiring few or no annotated training examples.\""

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The problem of interpreting instructions written in natural language has been widely studied since the early days of artificial intelligence (Winograd, 1972; Di Eugenio, 1992). Mapping instructions to a sequence of executable actions would enable the automation of tasks that currently require human participation. Examples include configuring software based on how-to guides and operating simulators using instruction manuals. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework for inducing mappings from text to actions without the need for annotated training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For concreteness, consider instructions from a Windows troubleshooting guide on deleting temporary folders, shown in Figure 1. We aim to map this text to the corresponding low-level commands and parameters. For example, properly interpreting the third instruction requires clicking on a tab, finding the appropriate option in a tree control, and clearing its associated checkbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this and many other applications, the validity of a mapping can be verified by executing the induced actions in the corresponding environment and observing their effects. For instance, in the example above we can assess whether the goal described in the instructions is achieved, ie the folder is deleted. The key idea of our approach is to leverage the validation process as the main source of supervision to guide learning. This form of supervision allows us to learn interpretations of natural language instructions when standard supervised techniques are not applicable, due to the lack of human-created annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Reinforcement learning is a natural framework for building models using validation from an environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998). We assume that supervision is provided in the form of a reward function that defines the quality of executed actions. During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of given documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward. The learner's goal is to estimate a policy - a distribution over actions given instruction text and environment state - that maximizes future expected reward. Our policy is modeled in a log-linear fashion, allowing us to incorporate features of both the instruction text and the environment. We employ a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We evaluate our method on two distinct applications: Windows troubleshooting guides and puzzle game tutorials. The key findings of our experiments are twofold. First, models trained only with simple reward signals achieve surprisingly high results, coming within 11% of a fully supervised method in the Windows domain. Second, augmenting unlabeled documents with even a small fraction of annotated examples greatly reduces this performance gap, to within 4% in that domain. These results indicate the power of learning from this new form of automated supervision.\""

    "## 2. Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "\"__Grounded Language Acquisition__ Our work fits into a broader class of approaches that aim to learn language from a situated context (Mooney, 2008a; Mooney, 2008b; Fleischman and Roy, 2005; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Siskind, 2001; Oates, 2001). Instances of such approaches include work on inferring the meaning of words from video data (Roy and Pentland, 2002; Barnard and Forsyth, 2001), and interpreting the commentary of a simulated soccer game (Chen and Mooney, 2008). Most of these approaches assume some form of parallel data, and learn perceptual co-occurrence patterns. In contrast, our emphasis is on learning language by proactively interactin with an external environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"__Reinforcement Learning for Language Processing__ Reinforcement learning has been previously applied to the problem of dialogue management (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Roy et al., 2000; Litman et al., 2000; Singh et al., 1999). These systems converse with a human user by taking actions that emit natural language utterances. The reinforcement learning state space encodes information about the goals of the user and what they say at each time step. The learning problem is to find an optimal policy that maps states to actions, through a trial-and-error process of repeated interaction with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Reinforcement learning is applied very differently in dialogue systems compared to our setup. In some respects, our task is more easily amenable to reinforcement learning. For instance, we are not interacting with a human user, so the cost of interaction is lower. However, while the state space can be designed to be relatively small in the dialogue management task, our state space is determined by the underlying environment and is typically quite large. We address this complexity by developing a policy gradient algorithm that learns efficiently while exploring a small subset of the states."

    "## 3. Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our task is to learn a mapping between documents and the sequence of actions they express. Figure 2 shows how one example sentence is mapped to three actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"__Mapping Text To Actions__ As input, we are given a document $d$, comprising as sequence of sentences $(u_1, \\dots, u_l)$, where each $u_i$ is a sequence of words. Our goal is to map $d$ to a sequence of actions $\\overrightarrow{a} = (a_0,\\dots,a_{n-1})$. Actions are predicted and executed sequentially, meaning that action $a_i$ is executed before $a_{i+1}$ is predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"An action $a = (c, R, W')$ encompasses:\n",
    "- a _command_ $c$, eg `click`, or `type_into`\n",
    "- the command's _parameters_ $R$, eg the concrete text to type, such as `secpol.msc`, and\n",
    "- the words $W'$ associated with $c$ and $R$, eg 'please type secpol.msc in the open box'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Elements of $R$ refer to _objects_ available in the _environment state_, as described below. Some parameters can also refer to words in document $d$. Additionally, to account for words that do not describe any actions, $c$ can be a null command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"__The Environment__ The environment state $\\mathcal{E}$ specifies the set of objects available for interaction, and their properties. In Figure 2, $\\mathcal{E}$ is shown on the right. The environment state $\\mathcal{E}$ changes in response to the execution of command $c$ with parameters $R$ according to a transition distribution $p(\\mathcal{E}' \\mid \\mathcal{E}, c, R)$. This distribution is _a priori_ unknown to the learner. As we will see in Section 5, our approach avoids having to directly estimate this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"__State__ To predict actions sequentially, we need to track the state of the document-to-actions mapping over time. A _mapping state_ $s$ is a tuple $(\\mathcal{E}, d, j, W)$, where $\\mathcal{E}$ refers to the current environment state; $j$ is the index of the sentence currently being interpreted in document $d$; and $W$ contains words that were mapped by previous actions for the same sentence. The mapping state $s$ is observed after each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The initial mapping state $s_0$ for document $d$ is $(\\mathcal{E}_d, d, 0, \\emptyset)$; $\\mathcal{E}_d$ is the unique starting environment for $d$. Performing action $a$ in state $s = (\\mathcal{E}, d, j, W)$ leads to a new state $s'$ according to distribution $p(s' \\mid s, a)$, defined as follows: $\\mathcal{E}$ transitions according to $p(\\mathcal{E}' \\mid \\mathcal{E}, c, R)$, $W$ is updated with $a$'s selected words, and $j$ is incremented if all words of the sentence have been mapped. For the applications we consider in this work, environment state transitions, and consequently mapping state transitions, are deterministic.\n"
