    "\"In many applications we want to compute $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{X})]$ where $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is nearly zero outside a region $A$ for which $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{X} \\in A)$ is small. The set $A$ may have small volume, or it may be in the tail of the $\\mathbf{X}$ distribution. A plain Monte Carlo sample from the distribution $\\mathbf{X}$ could fail to have even one point inside the region $A$. Problems of this type arise in high energy physics, Bayesian inference, rare event simulation for finance and insurance, and rendering in computer graphics among other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is clear intuitively that we must get some samples from the interesting or important region. We do this by sampling from a distribution that over-weights the important region, hence the name __importance sampling__. Having oversampled the important region, we have to adjust our estimate somehow to account for having sampled from this other distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Importance sampling can bring enormous gains, making an otherwise infeasible problem amenable to Monte Carlo. It can also backfire, yielding an estimate with infinite variance when simple Monte Carlo would have had a finite variance. It is the hardest variance reduction method to use well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Importance sampling is more than just a variance reduction method. It can be used to study one distribution while sampling from another. As a result we can use importance sampling as an alternative to acceptance-rejection sampling, as a method for sensitivity analysis and as the foundation for some methods of computing normalizing constants of probability densities. Importance sampling is also an important prerequisite for sequential Monte Carlo. For these reasons we spend a whole chapter on it.\""
